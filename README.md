# Ensemble-Models
**About Algorithm:**<br/>
Most of the errors from a modelâ€™s learning are from three main factors: variance, noise, and bias.The idea behind ensemble models is to train different models each with an objective to classify objects.By combining many models we increase stability to model thereby decreasing error and variance.Bagging,Boosting,Stacking,Casting are some of the ensemble models used. Here I have trained data using Random forest and Light Gradient Boosting Decision tree.I have also hypertuned these models using Grid search. <br/>
**Data:**
I have used Amazon data which contains summary of reviews that is featurized using NLP techniques(Bag of words,TfIdf,Average word2vec,TfIdf word2vec) gives higher dimensional.The Amazon data that is been used has already been pre-processed and loaded.
